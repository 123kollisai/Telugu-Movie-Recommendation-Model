# Telugu-Movie-Recommendation-Model
This project is a Telugu Movie Recommendation System designed to recommend movies based on user preferences. Built using Python, the system employs the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm along with cosine similarity to find and suggest movies that align closely with the user's interests.
Features
Movie Recommendations: Suggests Telugu movies based on user preferences and viewing patterns.
Algorithmic Approach: Utilizes the KNN algorithm to identify similar movies.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the closeness of movies based on their features, ensuring accurate recommendations.
Datasets
Telugu Movies Dataset:
Contains detailed information about Telugu movies, including genres, ratings, release year, and more.
User-Movie Ratings Dataset (Custom):
Includes user ratings or interactions with movies to enhance recommendation accuracy.
Algorithm and Approach
1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Purpose: Identifies movies similar to those the user has rated or preferred.
Working: Searches for the top K movies closest to the userâ€™s choices based on their features.
2. Cosine Similarity
Purpose: Measures similarity between movies by evaluating how closely their features (e.g., genres, ratings) align in multidimensional space.
Benefit: Accurately identifies relationships even when the magnitude of features varies, making it ideal for recommendation systems.
